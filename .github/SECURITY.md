# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I just try to using security policy, I used to update the latest version of dependencies, and I also setup `depandabot` to check security problems.

If you found any vulnerability, please send me a [mail](mailto:huuquyetng@gmail.com) or ping me at [x.com](https://x.com/huuquyetng)
